# STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Java)

## Description 
Group project that consisted of creating a student management system using Java.
The project was developed using JPane and the BlueJ IDE.

This section describes the user interface of our Java project. It is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Below are the key functionalities accessible through the graphical interface:

#### 1. CADASTRAR ALUNO (Register Student):
- Allows users to input details such as name, age, RG (ID), Student Registration Number (RA), semester, and course to register new students in the system.

#### 2. REMOVER ALUNO (Remove Student):
- Users can search for a student by their RA and remove them from the system.
  
#### 3. LISTAR ALUNOS (List Students):
- Displays a list of all registered students.

#### 4. LER ARQUIVOS (Read Files):
- Functionality related to reading data from files.

#### 5. SALVAR PROGRESSO (Save Progress):
- Allows users to save their current progress to a file on their computer.

#### 6. SAIR (Exit):
- Exits the registration menu.

## Technical Details
In this section, we’ll cover the technical aspects of our project:

#### 1. Data Structures Choice:
- By modifying a commented line in the cadastro package's Cadastro class, users can switch between using a dynamic vector or an array list to store student information.

#### File Persistence:
- Our project supports file persistence, allowing users to save and retrieve their progress seamlessly.

#### Preloaded Data File:
- The main project includes a file named "alunosCadastrados.ser" containing pre-entered student data for testing purposes.
